1-) What kind of spatial and thematic data you store?
We keep raster, elevation, vector data. We also keep it as a 3D object.
2-) Do you use a DBMS? If so, which one(s)?
Yes, using ArcGIS server database. In addition, PostGRES, PostgreSQL MSSQL Server are used for vector data.
3-) Is it a relational database? If so how many tables do you have?
MSSQL vs PostgreSQL is used relationally. There are different tables for projects, and they are too many in number.
4-) Why do you think the use of DBMS is important? What is the main benefit to your operation/product/daily use?
Handy for quickly accessing our own data and collecting data under one roof. It facilitates the management of data, thus it is very useful for us in finding and presenting the data we want. We can see the changes made by the operators on the system.
5-) What do you think is the main source of trouble in using a DBMS?
If the installation of the system is done regularly, it will not cause any problems.
6-) Assume you have a team of Geomatics Engineers. Consider that employee A has very good skills in databases and programming and employee B does not possess these skills. Considering that you have the financial freedom and that you paying X TL to employee B; how much would you pay to employee A?
An engineer who has skills in databases and programming will start with a salary of 1500-2000 TL more than the other engineer.
